# Consumer Transaction Analysis Report 

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that analyzes customer spending patterns across multiple dimensions. The analysis uses transaction data to uncover **trends, insights, and patterns** in consumer behavior.  

## Contents  
- **`Spending_Analysis_Report_Updated.ipynb`** → Interactive notebook with code, charts, and insights.  
- **Datasets**:  
  - Yearly Spending Trend  
  - Average Spending by Gender  
  - Monthly Spending Trend  
  - Total Transactions by Category  
  - Total Transactions by Month  

## Analysis Overview  
The notebook explores:  
- **Yearly Spending Trend** → total spending across years.  
- **Monthly Spending Trend** → seasonal peaks and dips.  
- **Spending by Gender** → average differences between male and female customers.  
- **Transactions by Category** → most frequent and highest-spending categories.  
- **Transactions by Month** → transaction volume across the calendar year.  
- **Top 10 Customers & Merchants** → highest spenders and top-performing merchants.  

## Visualizations  
The report includes clear visual charts such as:  
- Bar charts of **transactions and spending by category**  
- Line chart of **transactions by month**  
- Yearly and monthly spending trends  
- Gender-based spending comparisons  

## Insights  
- Spending behavior shows strong **seasonality** (certain months consistently peak).  
- **Market and Travel** categories dominate spending volume.  
- Gender-based analysis highlights differences in average spend.  
- Identifying **top customers and merchants** can help in loyalty strategies.
